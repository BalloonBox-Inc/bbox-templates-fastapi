# FastAPI Routers

This directory contains all the API routers, where the file `middleware.py` acts as an aggregator of all the routers. `exceptions.py` refers to the exception messages that are returned to the API when some unexpected event appens. `schemas.py` contains all schemas needed for requesting and responding an API router call.
